# **AudioMuse-AI - Where Music Takes Shape** 

<p align="center">

</p>


AudioMuse-AI is an open-source, Dockerized environment that brings **automatic playlist generation** to your self-hosted music library. Using tools such as [Librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/), it performs **sonic analysis** on your audio files locally, allowing you to curate playlists for any mood or occasion without relying on external APIs.

Deploy it easily on your local machine with Docker Compose or Podman, or scale it in a Kubernetes cluster (supports **AMD64** and **ARM64**). It integrates with the main music servers' APIs such as [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org), [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), [LMS](https://github.com/epoupon/lms/tree/master), [Lyrion](https://lyrion.org/), and [Emby](https://emby.media). More integrations may be added in the future.

AudioMuse-AI lets you explore your music library in innovative ways, just **start with an initial analysis**, and you’ll unlock features like:
* **Clustering**: Automatically groups sonically similar songs, creating genre-defying playlists based on the music's actual sound.
* **Instant Playlists**: Simply tell the AI what you want to hear—like "high-tempo, low-energy music" and it will instantly generate a playlist for you.
* **Music Map**: Discover your music collection visually with a vibrant, genre-based 2D map.
* **Playlist from Similar Songs**: Pick a track you love, and AudioMuse-AI will find all the songs in your library that share its sonic signature, creating a new discovery playlist.
* **Song Paths**: Create a seamless listening journey between two songs. AudioMuse-AI finds the perfect tracks to bridge the sonic gap.
* **Sonic Fingerprint**: Generates playlists based on your listening habits, finding tracks similar to what you've been playing most often.
* **Song Alchemy**: Mix your ideal vibe, mark tracks as "ADD" or "SUBTRACT" to get a curated playlist and a 2D preview. Export the final selection directly to your media server.
* **Text Search**: search your song with simple text that can contains mood, instruments and genre like calm piano songs.

## Quick Start Deployment

Get AudioMuse-AI running in minutes with Docker Compose. 

If you need more deployment example take a look at [DEPLOYMENT](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) page.

For a full list of configuration parameter take a look at [PARAMETERS](docs/PARAMETERS.md) page.

For the architecture design of AudioMuse-AI, take a look to the [ARCHITECTURE](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) page.

**Prerequisites:**
* Docker and Docker Compose installed
* A running media server (Jellyfin, Navidrome, Lyrion, or Emby)
* See [Hardware Requirements](#hardware-requirements)

**Steps:**

1. **Create your environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp deployment/.env.example deployment/.env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` with your media server credentials:**
   
   **For Jellyfin:**
   ```env
   MEDIASERVER_TYPE=jellyfin
   JELLYFIN_URL=http://your-jellyfin-server:8096
   JELLYFIN_USER_ID=your-user-id
   JELLYFIN_TOKEN=your-api-token
   ```
   
   **For Navidrome:**
   ```env
   MEDIASERVER_TYPE=navidrome
   NAVIDROME_URL=http://your-navidrome-server:4533
   NAVIDROME_USER=your-username
   NAVIDROME_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```
   
   **For Lyrion:**
   ```env
   MEDIASERVER_TYPE=lyrion
   LYRION_URL=http://your-lyrion-server:9000
   ```

   **For Emby:**
   ```env
   MEDIASERVER_TYPE=emby
   EMBY_URL=http://your-emby-server:8096
   EMBY_USER_ID=your-user-id
   EMBY_TOKEN=your-api-token
   ```

   **For Local Files (No Media Server):**
   ```env
   MEDIASERVER_TYPE=localfiles
   LOCALFILES_MUSIC_DIRECTORY=/path/to/your/music
   LOCALFILES_PLAYLIST_DIR=/path/to/your/music/playlists
   ```

3. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose-unified.yaml up -d
   ```
   > For NVIDIA GPU acceleration, use `docker-compose-unified-nvidia.yaml` instead.
   > The unified compose file supports all provider types (Jellyfin, Navidrome, Lyrion, Emby, LocalFiles).

4. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser at `http://localhost:8000`

5. **Run your first analysis:**
   - Navigate to "Analysis and Clustering" page
   - Click "Start Analysis" to scan your library
   - Wait for completion, then explore features like clustering and music map

**Stopping the services:**
```bash
docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose-unified.yaml down
```

## Multi-Provider Support

AudioMuse-AI supports connecting to multiple media servers simultaneously, allowing you to:
- Share analysis data across providers (analyze once, use everywhere)
- Create playlists on multiple servers at once
- Use a GUI Setup Wizard for easy configuration

### GUI Setup Wizard

Access the Setup Wizard at `http://localhost:8000/setup` to:
1. Add and configure multiple providers
2. Test connections before saving
3. Auto-detect music path prefixes for cross-provider matching
4. Set a primary provider for playlist creation

### Local Files Provider

The Local Files provider scans your music directory directly without requiring a media server:
- Supports MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, WAV, WMA, AAC, and OPUS formats
- Extracts metadata from embedded tags (ID3, Vorbis comments, etc.)
- Creates M3U playlists in a configurable directory
- Extracts ratings from POPM, TXXX:RATING, and Vorbis RATING tags

**Configuration:**
```env
MEDIASERVER_TYPE=localfiles
LOCALFILES_MUSIC_DIRECTORY=/music              # Path to your music library
LOCALFILES_PLAYLIST_DIR=/music/playlists       # Where to save generated playlists
LOCALFILES_FORMATS=.mp3,.flac,.ogg,.m4a,.wav   # Supported audio formats
LOCALFILES_SCAN_SUBDIRS=true                   # Scan subdirectories
```

### Cross-Provider Track Matching

When using multiple providers, tracks are matched across servers using normalized file paths. This allows:
- Analysis data to be reused across providers
- Playlists to be created on any provider using tracks from another
- Automatic ID remapping when creating cross-provider playlists

### Extended Metadata Fields

AudioMuse-AI now stores additional metadata for each track:
- **album_artist**: The album artist (useful for compilations)
- **year**: Release year extracted from various tag formats
- **rating**: User rating on 0-5 scale (from tags or media server)
- **file_path**: Normalized file path for cross-provider linking

> NOTE: by default AudioMuse-AI is deployed WITHOUT authentication layer and its suited only for LOCAL deployment. If you want to configure it have a look to the  [AUTHENTICATION](docs/AUTH.md) docs. If you enable the Authentication Layer, you need to be sure that any plugin used support and use the AudioMuse-AI API TOKEN

## **Hardware Requirements**

AudioMuse-AI has been tested on:
* **Intel**: HP Mini PC with Intel i5-6500, 16 GB RAM and NVMe SSD
* **ARM**: Raspberry Pi 5, 8 GB RAM and NVMe SSD / Mac Mini M4 16GB / Amphere based VM with 4core 8GB ram

**Minimum requirements:**
* CPU: 4-core Intel with AVX2 support (usually produced in 2015 or later) or ARM
* RAM: 8 GB RAM
* DISK: NVME SSD storage

For more information about the GPU deployment requirements have a look to the [GPU](docs/GPU.md) page.

## **Docker Image Tagging Strategy**

Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and publishes Docker images with the following tags:

* **`:latest`**
  Stable build from the **main** branch.
  **Recommended for most users.**

* **`:devel`**
  Development build from the **devel** branch.
  May be unstable — **for testing and development only.**

* **`:X.Y.Z`** (e.g. `:1.0.0`, `:0.1.4-alpha`)
  Immutable images built from **Git release tags**.
  **Ideal for reproducible or pinned deployments.**

* **`-noavx2`** variants
  Experimental images for CPUs **without AVX2 support**, using legacy dependencies.
  **Not recommended** unless required for compatibility.

* **`-nvidia`** variants
  Images that support the use of GPU for both Analysis and Clustering.
  **Not recommended** for old GPU.
